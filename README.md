# FeedForward – Smart Food Donation & Sustainability Platform

![alt text](img.png)

FeedForward is a modern web prototype that connects individuals, restaurants, and stores with nearby communities to **donate surplus food**, reducing waste and increasing access to food.  
It also helps manage **non-edible waste** by converting it into compost and bone meal — fighting hunger while promoting sustainability. 🌱
